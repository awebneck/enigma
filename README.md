# enigma

A fun little enigma emulator I banged out in clojure after watching The
Imitation Game.

## Usage

See the code. There's no CLI (because JVM, amirite), but you can REPL up
and play with it. I've tested this against actual enigma ciphertexts
with full success, so I'm pretty sure it's accurate (at least for the
3-wheel model)
